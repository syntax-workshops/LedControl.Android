# LED control

This is a simple app for controlling the color and brightness of my **ws2812b** RGB LED strip, based on the esp8266 (NodeMCU) platform.

It lets the user select a color and brightness level, which are automatically sent over the local network to the LED strip.
The LED strip maintains the last color/brightness values it received until the user restarts it.
